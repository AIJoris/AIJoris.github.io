Welcome! I am Joris and I'm an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD Candidate at the University of Amsterdam.
I'm working at the intersection of machine learning, language and interpretabilty, 
and I'm happy to be supervised by [Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) 
and [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/). I used to work at DPG Media as ML Engineer and team lead.
Check the [about](about) page to learn more about what I do and have done.

I occasionally write blogposts. You can find them down below.
