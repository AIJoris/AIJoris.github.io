Welcome! I am an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD Candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. I'm very happy to work with [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/), [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) and [Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/). I'm currently a summer intern at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/), and I'm affiliated with the [NLPnorth](https://nlpnorth.github.io/) group at ITU in Copenhagen and [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io/) at LMU in Munich. Previously, I worked at DPG Media as an ML engineer and team lead on large scale news recommendation.

I’m interested in understanding how large language models represent uncertainty, and if we can disentangle uncertainty caused by data (for example, underspecified, subjective or ambiguous inputs) from uncertainty related to the model used to capture the data.
