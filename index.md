Welcome! I am Joris, a second year [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD Candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. I'm very happy to be supervised by [Prof. Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and [Prof. Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/). I'm also affiliated with the [NLPnorth](https://nlpnorth.github.io/) group in Copenhagen. Previously, I worked at DPG Media as an ML engineer and team lead.

I'm interested in using both human and model uncertainty to interpret NLP systems' predictions, i.e., do models know when they don't know? I'm also into evaluating uncertainty estimates (e.g., calibration), and generated text (e.g., how "human-like" is this text), and developing principled ways to deal with human uncertainty and annotator disagreement, embracing the subjectivity and ambiguity of the real world instead of resorting to gold labels.
