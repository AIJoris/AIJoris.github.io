Welcome on my website! I am Joris and I am interested in very many things. An important one is research at the intersection of machine learning and language. Some others are probabilistic models, representation learning, interpretability, and hiking. Check the [about](invalid_link) page to learn more about what I do and have done.

I occasionally write blogposts. You can find them down below.
