Welcome! I am Joris, a second year [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD Candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. I'm very happy to work with [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/), [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) and [Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/). I'm also affiliated with the [NLPnorth](https://nlpnorth.github.io/) group at ITU in Copenhagen and [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io/) at LMU in Munich. Previously, I worked at DPG Media as an ML engineer and team lead.

I’m interested in using uncertainty to interpret NLP systems and developing principled ways to incorporate and deal with human uncertainty and annotator disagreement.
