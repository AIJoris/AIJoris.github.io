Welcome! I am Joris and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Amsterdam.
I'm working at the intersection of machine learning, language and interpretabilty, 
and I'm happy to be supervised by [Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) 
and [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/). 
I recently became more interested in probabilistic models such as VAEs and Bayesian Deep Learning for text. 
I also like software engineering and hiking. Prior to this, I worked at DPG Media as a ML Engineer and team lead.
Check the [about](about) page to learn more about what I do and have done.

I occasionally write blogposts. You can find them down below.
