Welcome! I am an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam working with [Wilker Aziz](https://wilkeraziz.github.io/), [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) and [Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/).

I am interested in understanding how large language models represent uncertainty, and if we can disentangle uncertainty in data (for example, underspecified, subjective or ambiguous language) from uncertainty related to the model that we use to capture this data.



I am affiliated with the [Dialogue Modeling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/) in Amsterdam, [NLPnorth](https://nlpnorth.github.io/) at ITU in Copenhagen and [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io/) at LMU in Munich. Previously, I was as summer intern at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/) in Seattle, and spent a few years at DPG Media as an ML engineer and team lead for large scale news recommendation.
