Welcome! I am Joris and I am a PhD Candidate at the [Institute of Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam.
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing and interpretabilty. I'm part of the [Dialogue Modeling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/). 

I am happy to be supervised by [Prof. Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) 
and [Prof. Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) and to be part of the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) network. 
Previously I worked at DPG Media as ML Engineer and team lead.
Check out the [about](about) page to learn more about what I do and have done.

Occasionally I write blogposts. You can find them down below.
