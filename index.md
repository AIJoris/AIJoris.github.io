Welcome! I am Joris and I am a PhD Candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. I'm very happy to be supervised by [Prof. Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and [Prof. Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/). My PhD is funded by [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) and I'm also affiliated with the [NLPnorth](https://nlpnorth.github.io/) group in Copenhagen. Previously, I worked at DPG Media as an ML engineer and team lead.

I am broadly interested in understanding *when* and *why* modern neural networks trained for language tasks work, and how we should interpret their predictions. Recently, I've been interested in uncertainty estimation and calibration as a tool to do that.
