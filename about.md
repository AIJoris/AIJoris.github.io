I am a PhD Candidate at the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. 
I am supervised by [Prof. Raquel Fernández](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/), who leads the [Dialogue Modeling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/), and [Prof. Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) who leads a lab that's part of the IT University of Copenhagen's [NLPnorth Unit](https://nlpnorth.github.io/).
My PhD is part of [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/). Previously I worked at DPG Media as ML Engineer & team lead.


### Education
I have an undergraduate and graduate degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam, and studied at the University of Toronto for one semester. I focused on NLP, deep learning, fundamental ML theory and statistics.

I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of [Maartje ter Hoeve](https://maartjeth.github.io/), [Anne Schuth](https://www.anneschuth.nl/), Marlies van der Wees and [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/).

In the past I have collaborated with [Dieuwke Hupkes](https://dieuwkehupkes.nl/) and [Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/) on compositionality in neural networks.
