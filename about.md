I am currently a machine learning engineer & product owner at *DPG Media*. I work on responsible news recommendation for major Dutch news titles such as de Volkskrant, het Parool, AD and nu.nl, reaching roughly 10 million users a day.

### Education
I have an undergraduate and graduate degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam and studied at the University of Toronto for one semester. I focused on NLP, deep learning, fundamental ML theory and statistics.

I wrote my master thesis under the supervision of [Maartje ter Hoeve](https://maartjeth.github.io/), [Anne Schuth](https://www.anneschuth.nl/), Marlies van der Wees and [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/).

In the past I have collaborated with [Dieuwke Hupkes](https://dieuwkehupkes.nl/) and [Elia Bruni](https://eliabruni.github.io/) on compositionality in neural networks.

### Industry
- Research intern at *DPG Media* working on interpretability in transformers for abstractive summarization (master thesis).
- Research intern at *Infosys* in Bangalore working on robotic navigation in controlled environments.  
- ML Engineer at *YoungCapital* working on finding relevant candidates given a vacancy and vice versa.
